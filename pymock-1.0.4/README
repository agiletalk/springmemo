This is a mock object package modeled on java's easytest.  It
handles properties, functions, methods, classes, and generators.
It also allows you to mock out methods within existing modules
and classes.  (E.g. mocking out os.listdir for the duraction
of a test.)

If you have any questions then please contact me. My address
